# Project Status

## RSS Phase Status

- Phase RSS.7.2 — FeedSource Operational API: in progress
- Implementing lightweight internal operational API for managing FeedSource records
- Exposing 5 endpoints:
  - `GET /api/v1/internal/rss/feed-sources` — List all FeedSources
  - `GET /api/v1/internal/rss/feed-sources/:id` — Get a single FeedSource
  - `POST /api/v1/internal/rss/feed-sources` — Create a new FeedSource
  - `PATCH /api/v1/internal/rss/feed-sources/:id` — Update a FeedSource
  - `DELETE /api/v1/internal/rss/feed-sources/:id` — Delete a FeedSource
- Created FeedSourceService for CRUD operations with URL uniqueness validation
- Added CreateFeedSourceDto and UpdateFeedSourceDto for type-safe input validation
- Added comprehensive regression tests for both service and controller
- No Prisma schema changes, no migrations, no synchronization logic changes
- Podcast/Episode ownership remains unchanged

- Phase RSS.7.1 — Internal Synchronization API: completed
- The synchronization layer is now exposed through a minimal internal API with 4 endpoints:
  - `POST /api/v1/internal/rss/sync/:feedSourceId` — Sync a single FeedSource
  - `POST /api/v1/internal/rss/sync` — Sync all FeedSources sequentially
  - `GET /api/v1/internal/rss/status` — Get status for all FeedSources
  - `GET /api/v1/internal/rss/status/:feedSourceId` — Get status for a single FeedSource
- The controller delegates all logic to RssSyncOrchestrator, which coordinates existing services (Fetcher, Parser, Normalizer, SynchronizationService)
- No synchronization logic was duplicated; existing services are reused and unchanged
- The API is internal-only and isolated from the public Podcast/Episode API surface

## Verification

- Backend build: passed
- API regression tests: 47/47 passed (all existing tests continue to pass)
- No scheduler, queue, worker, or API contract changes were introduced
- ESLint errors: 5 pre-existing parsing errors in unrelated .spec.ts files (not new)

## Frontend PWA Status

- Phase PWA.1 — Web App Installation Support: completed
- Added a minimal manifest and install metadata for the web app, exposed the manifest through the shared app layout, and registered a small service worker for supported browsers.
- Added a lightweight install banner in the shared app shell that reacts to the browser install prompt without interrupting the existing experience.
- Kept the change scoped to the app shell and configuration layer; Player, Podcast, Episode, Library, and Profile features remain unchanged.

## Frontend Creator Economy Status

- Phase CREATOR.4 — Creator Economy, Rewards & Monetization Foundation: completed
- Added a mock-backed creator economy experience to the Creator route with revenue metrics, support/contribution patterns, premium content tiers, membership benefits, milestone rewards, and collaboration placeholders.
- The implementation stays UI-only and does not introduce backend, payments, or real monetization flows.
- Web regression coverage and build verification are passing.

## Frontend Admin Intelligence Status

- Phase ADMIN.3 — Platform Intelligence, Analytics & Decision Center: completed
- Added a feature-owned intelligence workspace under the existing Admin experience with typed mock analytics data for platform KPIs, growth signals, retention, content performance, creator health, community signals, trend intelligence, recommendation insights, and forecast panels.
- Kept the experience UI-only and mock-backed; no backend APIs, databases, analytics pipelines, tracking infrastructure, or permission systems were introduced.
- Added regression coverage for analytics rendering, growth sections, content intelligence, creator analytics, community insights, and empty/loading states.

## Frontend Player Runtime Status

- Phase Player.1 — MVP Playback Runtime: completed
- Player now restores the last selected episode and playback position from browser storage after refresh.
- Episode metadata remains the only responsibility of the Episode feature; the Player runtime owns playback lifecycle and persistence.
- Phase PLAYER.7 — UX & Accessibility Polish: completed
- The current player experience now includes clearer resume hints, actionable retry flows for playback failures, improved accessibility labels/ARIA values, Escape-based queue dismissal, and stronger state messaging while preserving the existing runtime architecture.
- Web test/lint/build verification: passed

## Frontend Profile Architecture Status

- Phase PROFILE.4 — Profile Modular Migration & Architecture Consolidation: completed
- The Profile page is now assembled from modular feature-owned sections with a single shared profile section shell and the existing Hero/Journey/Knowledge/Creator/Social collection components.
- Continue Listening is now wired to the real Library continuation hook and reused through the existing Library continuation section, avoiding duplicated fetch logic or state.
- The deprecated profile experience fields that were no longer needed after the migration were removed from the shared profile experience type.
- Web regression coverage for Profile rendering, section visibility, loading state, empty state, and continue-listening display is passing.
